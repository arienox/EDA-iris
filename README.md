# Iris Flower Data EDA
This code uses pandas and various visualizations to perform EDA on a dataset of iris flower data. Summary statistics, scatter plots, pair plots, a heatmap, and a box plot are used to explore the data and identify patterns and relationships between features.
This code performs basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about various species of iris flowers. The data is read in using pandas and various statistical summary measures are printed. Visualizations such as count plots, scatter plots, pair plots, a heatmap, and a box plot are used to explore the data and identify patterns and relationships between features. These visualizations and summary measures can be useful for understanding the characteristics of the data and identifying potential issues or areas for further analysis.

## Requirements
This code requires the following packages:
```
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
```
## Usage
To use this code, simply run the script in a Python environment. The visualizations will be displayed in a window.

## Data
The data used in this code is the famous Iris flower data set, which can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository at the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

## Notes
This is a basic EDA example and is meant to illustrate some common techniques for exploring and visualizing data. There are many other methods and techniques that can be used for EDA, and this code should not be taken as a comprehensive guide to the subject.
